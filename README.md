# Text_summarization

Types of Extraction-based Methods
I Statistical Method: Text summarization based on this approach re-
lies on the statistical distribution of certain features and it is done
without understanding whole document. Models rank the sentences
of the original text to appear in the summary in the order of impor-
tance. We are using average TF-ISF, title Word, sentence length, sen-
tence feature, thematic word and numerical data as statistical features
in our proposal.
II Linguistic Method: In this, method needs to be aware of and know
deeply the linguistic knowledge, so that the computer will be able to
analyse the sentences and then decide which sentence to be selected.
We are using proper noun feature and sentence to sentence similarity
as linguistic features in our proposal.
III Hybrid Method: It is the combination of statical and Linguistic meth-
ods.It optimizes best of both the previous methods for meaningful and
short summary.
